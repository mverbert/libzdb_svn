#ifndef CONNECTION_INCLUDED
#define CONNECTION_INCLUDED


/**
 * A <b>Connection</b> represent a connection to a SQL database system.
 *
 * Use a Connection to execute SQL statements. There are three ways to
 * execute a SQL statement: Connection_execute() is used to execute SQL 
 * statements that does not return a result set. Such statements are INSERT,
 * UPDATE or DELETE.  Connection_executeQuery() is used to execute a SQL 
 * SELECT statement and return a result set. These methods can only handle
 * values which can be expressed as C-strings. If you need to handle binary
 * data, such as inserting a blob value into the database, use a 
 * PreparedStatement object to execute the SQL statement. The factory method
 * Connection_prepareStatement() is used to obtain a PreparedStatement object. 
 *
 * The method Connection_executeQuery() will return an empty ResultSet (not null)
 * if the SQL statement did not return any values.  A ResultSet lives until the
 * next call to Connection execute or until the Connection is returned
 * to the Connection Pool. If an error occur during execution, an SQLException
 * is thrown.
 *
 * Any SQL statement that changes the database (basically, any SQL
 * command other than SELECT) will automatically start a transaction
 * if one is not already in effect. Automatically started transactions
 * are committed at the conclusion of the command.
 *
 * Transactions can also be started manually using 
 * Connection_beginTransaction(). Such transactions usually persist
 * until the next call to Connection_commit() or Connection_rollback().
 * A transaction will also rollback if the database is closed or if an 
 * error occurs. Nested transactions are not allowed.
 *
 * <i>A Connection is reentrant, but not thread-safe and should only be used by one thread (at the time).</i>
 *
