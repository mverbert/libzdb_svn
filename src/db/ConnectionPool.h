/**
 * A <b>ConnectionPool</b> represent a database connection pool.
 *
 * A connection pool can be used to get a connection to a database and
 * execute statements. This class opens a number of database
 * connections and allow callers to obtain and use a database connection in
 * a reentrant manner. Applications can instantiate as many ConnectionPool
 * objects as needed and against as many different database systems as needed.
 *
 *  <center><img src="database.png"></center>
 *
 * The method ConnectionPool_getConnection() is used to obtain a new
 * connection from the pool. If there are no connections available it will
 * create a new connection and return this. If the pool has already
 * handed out <i>maxConnections</i> the next call to 
 * ConnectionPool_getConnection() will return NULL. Use Connection_close() 
 * to return a connection to the pool so it can be reused.
 *
 * A connection pool is created default with 5 initial connections and 
 * with 20 maximum connections. These values can be changed by the property 
 * methods ConnectionPool_setInitialConnections() and 
 * ConnectionPool_setMaxConnections(). 
 *
 * <h2>Supported database systems:</h2>
 * This library may be built with support for many different database 
 * systems. To test if a particular system is supported use the method 
 * Connection_isSupported().  
 *
 * <h2>Life-cycle methods:</h2>
 * Clients should call ConnectionPool_start() to establish the connection pool 
 * against the database server before using the pool. To shutdown 
 * connections from the database server use ConnectionPool_stop(). Set
 * preferred properties <em>before</em> calling ConnectionPool_start(). Some 
 * properties can also be changed dynamically after the pool was started such as
 * changing the maximum number of connections or the number of initial connections. 
 * Changing and tuning these properties at runtime is most useful if the pool was 
 * started with a reaper-thread (see below) since the reaper dynamically change the
 * size of the pool
 
 *
 * <h2>Connection URL:</h2>
 * The URL given to a Connection Pool at creation time specify a database 
 * connection on the standard URL format. The format of the connection URL 
 * is defined as:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <center><code>
 * database://[user:password@][host][:port]/database[?propertyName1][=propertyValue1][&propertyName2][=propertyValue2]...
 * </code></center>
 * \endhtmlonly
 * 
 * The property names <code>user</code> and <code>password</code> are always
 * recognized and specify how to login to the database. Other properties 
 * depends on the database server in question. User name and password can 
 * alternatively be specified in the auth-part of the URL. If port number is 
 * omitted, the default port number for the database server is used.
 *
 * <b>MySQL:</b>
 *
 * Here is an example on how to connect to a <a href="http://www.mysql.org/">
 * MySQL</a> database server:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * mysql://localhost:3306/test?user=root&password=swordfish<br/>
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * In this case the username, <code>root</code> and password, <code>swordfish
 * </code> are specified as properties to the URL. An alternative is to 
 * use the auth-part of the URL to specify authentication information:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * mysql://root:swordfish@localhost:3306/test
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * See <a href="mysqloptions.html">mysql options</a> for all properties that
 * can be set for a mysql connection URL.
 *
 * <b>SQLite:</b>
 *
 * For a <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> database the connection 
 * URL should simply specify a database file, since a SQLite database 
 * is just a file in the filesystem. SQLite uses 
 * <a href="http://sqlite.org/pragma.html">pragma commands</a> for 
 * performance tuning and other special purpose database commands. Pragma 
 * syntax on the form, <code>name=value</code> can be added as properties 
 * to the URL and will be set when the Connection is created. In addition 
 * to pragmas, the following properties are supported:
 * <ul>
 * <li><code>heap_limit=value</code> - Make SQLite auto-release unused memory 
 * if memory usage goes above the specified value [KB].</li> 
 * </ul>
 * An URL for 
 * connecting to a SQLite database might look like:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * sqlite:///var/sqlite/test.db?synchronous=normal&heap_limit=8000&foreign_keys=on
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * <b>PostgreSQL:</b>
 *
 * The URL for connecting to a <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">
 * PostgreSQL</a> database server might look like:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * postgresql://localhost:5432/test?user=root&password=swordfish<br/>
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * As with the MySQL URL, the username and password are specified as 
 * properties to the URL. Likewise, the auth-part of the URL can be used 
 * instead, to specify the username and the password:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * postgresql://root:swordfish@localhost/test?use-ssl=true
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 * 
 * In this example we have also omitted the port number to the server, in
 * which case the default port number, <i>5432</i>, for PostgreSQL is used. In
 * addition we have added an extra parameter to the URL, so connection to 
 * the server is done over a secure SSL connection.
 *
 * See <a href="postgresoptions.html">postgresql options</a> for all properties that
 * can be set for a postgresql connection URL.
 *
 * <b>Oracle:</b>
 *
 * The URL for connecting to an <a href="http://www.oracle.com/">
 * Oracle</a> database server might look like:
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * oracle://localhost:1521/test?user=scott&password=tiger<br/>
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *
 * The auth-part of the URL can be used instead to specify the username 
 * and the password. In addition, you may specify a service name in the URL
 * instead if you have setup a <code>tnsnames.ora</code> configuration file.
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * oracle:///servicename?user=scott&password=tiger
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 *  
 * <h2>Example:</h2>
 * To obtain a connection pool for a MySQL database, the code below can be
 * used. The exact same code can be used for PostgreSQL, SQLite and Oracle, 
 * the only change needed is to modify the Connection URL. Here we connect
 * to the database test on localhost and start the pool with the default 5
 * initial connections.
 *
 * \htmlonly
 * <dt><dd><code>
 * <pre>
 * URL_T url = URL_new("mysql://localhost/test?user=root&password=swordfish");
 * ConnectionPool_T pool = ConnectionPool_new(url);
 * ConnectionPool_start(pool);
 * [..]
 * <b>Connection_T con = ConnectionPool_getConnection(pool);</b>
 * ResultSet_T result = Connection_executeQuery(con, "select id, name, image from employee where salary>%d", anumber);
 * while (ResultSet_next(result)) 
 * {
 *      int id = ResultSet_getInt(result, 1);
 *      const char *name = ResultSet_getString(result, 2);
 *      int blobSize;
 *      const void *image = ResultSet_getBlob(result, 3, &blobSize);
 *      [..]
 * }
 * <b>Connection_close(con);</b>
 * [..]
 * ConnectionPool_free(&pool);
 * URL_free(&url);
 * </pre>
 * </code></dd></dt>
 * \endhtmlonly
 * 
 * <h2>Optimizing the pool size:</h2>
 * The pool can be setup to dynamically change the number of active 
 * Connections in the pool depending on the load. A single <code>reaper</code> 
 * thread can be activated at startup to sweep through the pool at a regular
 * interval and close Connections that have been inactive for a specified time
 * or for some reasons no longer respond. Only inactive Connections will be closed
 * and no more than the initial number of Connections the pool was started with
 * are closed. The property method, ConnectionPool_setReaper(), is used to specify
 * that a reaper thread should be started when the pool is started. This method 
 * <strong>must</strong> be called <i>before</i> ConnectionPool_start(), otherwise 
 * the pool will not start with a reaper thread.
 * 
 * Clients can also call the method, ConnectionPool_reapConnections(), to
 * bonsai the pool directly if the reaper thread is not activated.
 *
 * It is recommended to start the pool with a reaper-thread, especially if
 * the pool maintains TCP/IP Connections.
 *
 * <h2>Realtime inspection:</h2>
 * Two methods can be used to inspect the pool at runtime. The method 
 * ConnectionPool_size() returns the number of connections in the pool, that is,
 * both active and inactive connections. The method ConnectionPool_active() 
 * returns the number of active connections, i.e. those connections in 
 * current use by your application. 
 *
 * <i>This ConnectionPool is thread-safe.</i>
